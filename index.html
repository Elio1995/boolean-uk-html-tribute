    <h2>Geographyy</h2>
    <p>
      Mount Korab (Albanian: Maja e Korabit or Mali i Korabit; Macedonian: Голем
      Кораб, Golem Korab) is the highest peak of the eponymous mountain range
      and the fourth highest mountain entirely located in the Balkan Peninsula,
      standing at 2,764 metres (9,068 feet). The summit of the Korab mountain
      range in the Albanian-Macedonian border, Korab is the highest peak of
      Albania and North Macedonia and also one of only two summits in Europe,
      which are the highest point for more than one country. Mount Korab is also
      the 18th most prominent mountain peak in the European continent and the
      third on the Balkan Peninsula. Korab is situated within the Korab-Koritnik
      Nature Park. It is noted for its rich flora, including species such as
      Bosnian pine, European beech, Coppicing forest, and Alder forest.

    <h2>Climbing</h2>
    <p>
      There are no formal restrictions on climbing the mountain from the
      Albanian side. The area is now safer and more stable than it has been in
      recent times. It is possible to drive as far as the local village of
      Radomira, but the local infrastructure is generally not good. A four-wheel
      drive vehicle with high clearance may be required. There are no accurate
      and up to date maps, local signposting is poor, and hikers may have to
      overcome the additional problem of aggressive dogs. An international
      expedition to climb Mount Korab is organised each September by the
      mountain club PSD "Korab" in Skopje.
